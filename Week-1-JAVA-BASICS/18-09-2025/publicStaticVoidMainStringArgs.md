### ðŸ”Ž Breakdown of `public static void main(String[] args)`

1. **`public`**

   * Makes the method accessible from anywhere.
   * The JVM needs to access it from *outside* the class to start execution, so it must be `public`.
   * If it werenâ€™t `public`, the JVM couldnâ€™t call it.

2. **`static`**

   * Belongs to the class, not an object.
   * JVM calls `main` without creating an instance of the class.
   * Saves time and avoids unnecessary object creation when starting a program.

3. **`void`**

   * Means the method does not return any value.
   * The JVM doesnâ€™t expect any return value when starting execution â€” it just runs your code.
   * (Some languages like C return an int `main()` to indicate success/failure, but Java handles exit codes differently via `System.exit()`.)

4. **`main`**

   * Special method name recognized by the JVM as the entry point of the program.
   * Without `main`, your program compiles fine but wonâ€™t run because JVM wonâ€™t know where to start.

5. **`String[] args`**

   * Command-line arguments passed to the program.
   * Example:

     ```bash
     java HelloWorld one two three
     ```

     â†’ `args[0] = "one"`, `args[1] = "two"`, `args[2] = "three"`

### âœ… Your summary

* **public** â†’ JVM can call it from anywhere.
* **static** â†’ No object needed, JVM calls it directly.
* **void** â†’ No return value expected.
* **main** â†’ Reserved name as entry point.
