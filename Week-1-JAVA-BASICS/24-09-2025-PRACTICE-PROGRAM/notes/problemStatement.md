## 📝 Problem Statement:

**“The Friendship Manager”**

You are building a small program to **manage your friend circle**. The program should let you:

1. **Start with an array of friend ages** (e.g., `{19, 22, 20, 21, 25}`):

   * Sort the ages.
   * Search if a given age (e.g., `21`) exists using `binarySearch`.
   * Find the **youngest**, **oldest**, and **average age** (use Streams).

2. **Work with friend names (Strings & StringBuilder):**

   * Store names like `"Vibinn"`, `"Shastri"`, `"Prashanth"`.
   * Check if `"shastri"` is in the list (case-insensitive comparison).
   * Extract the first three letters of each name and display them as **nicknames**.
   * Use `StringBuilder` to build a sentence like:
     `"My best friends are: Vibinn, Shastri, and Prashanth."`
     → Then modify it to replace `"best"` with `"closest"`.

3. **Use an ArrayList for flexible friend management:**

   * Add new friends (user decides how many).
   * Remove one friend by name.
   * Print greetings for all remaining friends in UPPERCASE.

---

### 🎯 What this problem ensures:

* **Arrays** → sorting, searching, streams.
* **Strings** → substring, equals, equalsIgnoreCase, toUpperCase.
* **StringBuilder** → append, insert, replace.
* **ArrayList** → add, remove, iterate.

---

This way, your program feels like a **mini real-world app** instead of just a coding exercise.
