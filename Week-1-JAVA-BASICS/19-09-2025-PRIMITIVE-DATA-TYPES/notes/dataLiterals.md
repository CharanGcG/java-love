## ⚡ Why `float a = 1.3;` does **not** work

* In Java, **numeric literals have default types**:

  * **Whole number literal** → `int`
  * **Decimal literal** → `double`
* So when the compiler sees `1.3`, it says:

  > "This is a **double literal** (64-bit)."
* But you declared `float a` (32-bit).
  Assigning a 64-bit double to a 32-bit float can **lose precision**, so Java forces you to be explicit.

👉 That’s why you must write:

```java
float a = 1.3f;  // here, 1.3 is a float literal, no conversion problem
```

Without the `f`, the compiler thinks you’re trying to **narrow** `double → float`, which requires an explicit cast:

```java
float a = (float) 1.3;  // also works, but less neat
```

## ⚡ Why `long b = 12345678901;` does **not** work

* Any integer literal is an `int` **by default**.
* `12345678901` is too big for `int` (`int` max = 2,147,483,647).
* Compiler throws: *“integer number too large.”*

So you must use `L`:

```java
long b = 12345678901L;
```

If the number fits in an `int` range, the compiler allows it without `L`:

```java
long small = 1000;  // valid, because 1000 fits in int
```

But if it’s larger, suffix is required.

## ⚡ Why can’t Java just “infer”?

Because Java is **statically typed + literal rules are fixed**:

* Literals (`1.3`, `1234`) have intrinsic types (`double`, `int`) before assignment.
* Assignment **does not change the literal’s type**.
* Java designers wanted explicitness to avoid silent precision loss.

So:

* `float a = 1.3;` → ❌ compiler says: “that’s a double, be explicit if you want float.”
* `long b = 12345678901;` → ❌ compiler says: “that’s an int literal, but too big—tell me it’s long.”

---

✅ **Final Wisdom**:

* **Defaults:** `int` for whole numbers, `double` for decimals.
* **Suffixes:** Needed only when you want to escape the defaults (`L` for long, `f` for float).
