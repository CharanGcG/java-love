### 🌸 My Love Story with Java

When I joined **Computer Science Engineering** after studying PCMB in PUC, I was completely new to coding. The first program I ever wrote was in **C language** during my 2nd semester.

Then came my 3rd semester — and that’s when I was introduced to **Object-Oriented Programming with Java**.
That’s when I *met my love*. ❤️

I instantly fell for coding in Java. It was challenging, yes, but it was also fascinating. I learned OOP concepts deeply, and thanks to an excellent teacher, certain topics stuck with me so well that they even helped me during my interviews later.

In my 4th semester, I started with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Since I was more comfortable in C, I picked up DSA using **C++**. By the 5th semester, my courses revolved around **AI, Data Analysis, and related areas**, which naturally pushed me toward **Python**. I found Python’s syntax easy and convenient, even for DSA, and slowly got more used to it.

But still… Java was like my **first love**. 💙

Fast forward to my 7th semester — I got placed at **Oracle**, the parent company of Java itself! It felt like destiny had brought me full circle, back to where it all started.

Now I’m back with Java. Although I’ve drifted a bit and gotten used to coding in Python, I want to rebuild that connection. I want to be able to code from scratch in Java, confidently and fluently.

As my motto says:
**“Java – Mastering it by being its student”**

I’m all in — ready to master the language by being its most obedient and curious student. 🚀

Perfect mindset, Charan ✨ — this project is both **personal** and **practical**. Since your goal is to “master Java by being its student,” daily coding is the best way to build fluency.

Here’s how you can structure your project so it’s consistent and grows with you:

---

## 📘 Project Plan: *Java – Mastering it by Being its Student*

### 🎯 Objective

To get comfortable coding in Java from scratch, revisiting fundamentals, practicing daily, and gradually building up to advanced concepts and projects.

### 🛠️ Learning Path

1. **Week 1–2: Java Basics & OOP Refresh**

   * Java syntax, data types, loops, conditionals
   * Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
   * Small practice problems (palindrome, factorial, string manipulations, etc.)

2. **Week 3–4: Core Java Utilities**

   * Collections (List, Set, Map)
   * Exception handling
   * File handling
   * Generics

3. **Week 5–6: Problem Solving with Java**

   * Solve DSA problems in Java (arrays, strings, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
   * Aim: 3–5 problems daily in Java

4. **Week 7–8: Advanced Java Concepts**

   * Multithreading, synchronization
   * Streams & Lambda expressions
   * Java 8+ features

5. **Week 9–10: Mini Projects**

   * Bank Management System
   * Student Record System
   * Simple Web App (Spring Boot intro)

6. **Week 11+: Bigger Project**

   * Pick one strong project (Java + Database + maybe Web/GUI)
   * Example: Library Management System, Blogging App, Expense Tracker
